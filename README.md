# Random functions

I don't know yet what I want with these, but some are the product of a lot of time-intensive tinkering. Therefore, I'd like to preserve these here. I am especially fond of my function for a large circos plot. This is different from my convenience-function R-package because these functions are useless without their specific context. Only the code-snippets might have some use.
